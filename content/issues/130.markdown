<!-- 2018-10-25 -->

Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Haskell community priorities for GHC](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdh7sf2MqHoEmjt38r1cxCF-tV76OFCJqU6VabGzlOUKYqo-w/viewform)

    > We want to ask your advice about what our key priorities should be in developing GHC. Please help us by completing this very short, but open-ended, survey.

-   [Typed Functional Programming and Software Correctness](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2018/10/23/typed-functional-programming-and-software-correctness/)

    > In this post I'll explain why functional programming and static type systems are important for software correctness.

-   [*Category Theory for Programmers* by Bartosz Milewski is now available in hardcover!](https://np.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/9q6edo/category_theory_for_programmers_by_bartosz/)

    > It's been a wild ride! I'm happy to announce that after many bug fixes and tweaks, the book is now available to purchase on a print-on-demand service in full color print.

-   [Algebraic data types in four languages](https://blog.softwaremill.com/algebraic-data-types-in-four-languages-858788043d4e)

    > In this blog post, I'm going to compare how the concept of "sum" algebraic data types is supported by four languages I use, namely: Haskell, Scala, Rust, and TypeScript.

-   [Announcing Profiterole: GHC profile viewer](https://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2018/10/announcing-profiterole-ghc-profile.html)

    > Profiterole reads standard GHC `.prof` files and generates both textual and HTML reports which are typically more than 10x smaller.

-   [Applicative WTF?](https://blog.plover.com/prog/haskell/applicative.html)

    > While I was writing up last week's long article about Traversable, I wrote this stuff about Applicative also. This is a disorganized collection of loosely-related paragraphs on that topic.

-   [Introduction to singletons: Part 4](https://blog.jle.im/entry/introduction-to-singletons-4.html)

    > Hi again! Welcome back; let's jump right into the fourth and final part of our journey through the singleton design pattern and the great singletons library.

-   [REST-ish services in Haskell: Part 1](https://vadosware.io/post/rest-ish-services-in-haskell-part-1/)

    > A general tour through a bunch of patterns/strategies I use when developing robust-ish REST-ish web services with Haskell.

-   [`TChan` vs `TQueue`: What's the difference?](https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2018/10/12/tchan_vs_tqueue.html)

    > I always forget the difference between a `TChan` and a `TQueue`. They appear to have an almost identical API, so whenever I need a concurrent message thing, I spend some time working out what the difference is.

-   [Your easy guide to functional reactive programming](https://medium.com/@lettier/functional-reactive-programming-a0c7b08f6b67)

    > Managing state. It's the bane of programmers everywhere. The more stateful widgets there are, the harder it is to keep your app from becoming a giant mud pit. But fear not! You can use functional reactive programming (FRP) in your quest to manage state.

## Jobs

-   [Careers at Galois](https://galois.com/careers/)

    > Galois is growing and hiring Technical Project Leads, Software Engineers/Researchers, and Principal Scientists for all three of our locations (Portland, OR/Arlington, VA/Dayton, OH). Galwegians apply cutting edge computer science and mathematics to advance the state of the art in software and hardware trustworthiness. Engineers work in small team settings and must successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly cooperative and intellectually challenging environment. Creativity thrives in a work environment that respects employees' quality-of-life.

## Package of the week

This week's package of the week is [Toodles](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/toodles-0.1.0.11),
an application for managing `TODO` entries in your code.
It scrapes your entire repository for `TODO` entries and organizes them so you can manage your project directly from the code.
