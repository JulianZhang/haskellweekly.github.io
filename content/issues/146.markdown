<!-- 2019-02-14 -->

Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

-   [Isomorphism and Embedding](https://dimjasevic.net/marko/2019/02/09/isomorphism-and-embedding/) by Marko Dimjašević

    > To me as a programmer, to write mathematical proofs that are mechanically checked by a computer feels empowering. To have these proofs as executable programs feels even more empowering. Therefore, our proofs have a computational aspect and vice-versa: our programs have a logical aspect.

-   [Bank kata in Haskell - dealing with state](https://codurance.com/2019/02/11/bank-kata-in-haskell-state/) by Liam Griffin

    > In functional programming, you cannot encapsulate state or you lose it. Anything that is not returned from a function is lost. So, how do we deal with storing them?

-   [Freer Monads, More Better Programs](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/freer-monads/) by Sandy Maguire

    > As best I can tell, the community roughly fragments itself along four lines --- those who like `mtl`, those who say "just do everything in `Reader` `IO`", those who like the three layer cake, and those who think free(r) monads are worth their weight in gold.

-   [Haskell command-line utility using GHC generics](http://www.haskellforall.com/2019/02/haskell-command-line-utility-using-ghc.html) by Gabriel Gonzalez

    > My aim is to convince you that this Haskell feature improves code clarity without increasing the difficulty. If anything, I consider this version less difficult both to read and write.

-   [Haskell Data Types Review!](https://mmhaskell.com/blog/2019/2/11/haskell-data-types-review) by Monday Morning Haskell

    > This week we're taking a quick break from new content. We've added our new series on Haskell's data system to our permanent collection.

-   [Masking async tasks in the wild](https://lin-techdet.blogspot.com/2019/02/masking-async-tasks-in-wild.html)

    > A new task gets spawned synchronously from a C code and immediately returns a handle: an object of type `Async ()` wrapped inside a `StablePtr`. The spawned thread is not waited from anywhere, thus being run in the wild.

-   [Randomization Testing for an SQL Translator](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/randomization-testing-for-an-sql-translator) by Alexey Kuleshevich

    > Not all SQLs are created equal. I'll say even more, none of the SQL dialects are even close to being equal. In particular, when talking about Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL, their syntax might look similar. However, in their semantics, they are mountains apart.

-   [Refactoring Haskell: A Case Study](https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2019/02/12/refactoring-haskell/index.html) by Vaibhav Sagar

    > Many people claim that refactoring Haskell is a joy. I've certainly found this to be the case, but what does that mean in practice? I thought it might be useful to demonstrate by refactoring some of my own code.

-   [The ReaderT design pattern or tagless final?](https://magnus.therning.org/posts/2019-02-02-000-the-readert-design-pattern-or-tagless-final-.html) by Magnus Therning

    > The other week I read V. Kevroletin's *Introduction to Tagless Final* and realised that a couple of my projects, both at work and at home, would benefit from a refactoring to that approach.

-   [The types got you](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-02-13-types-got-you.html) by Mark Karpov

    > As the GHC compiler evolves and grows its feature set, one couldn't help but wonder about the connection between power provided by a programming language and the process of making design decisions when developing software.

## Jobs
